-- Usage information
\echo '\033[1;33mTimezone Names Information:\033[0m'
\echo '  • This query provides a cached view of pg_timezone_names'
\echo '  • For a persistent solution, consider creating a materialized view:'
\echo '  CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW timezone_names_mv AS SELECT * FROM pg_timezone_names;'
\echo '  CREATE INDEX ON timezone_names_mv(name);'
\echo '  REFRESH MATERIALIZED VIEW CONCURRENTLY timezone_names_mv;  -- Run periodically'
\echo '\033[1;33mPerformance Note:\033[0m'
\echo '  • Direct queries to pg_timezone_names are slow (~196ms per execution)'
\echo '  • The materialized view approach reduces query time significantly'
\echo '  • Timezone data rarely changes, making it ideal for caching'
