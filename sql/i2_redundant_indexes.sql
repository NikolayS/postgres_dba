--List of redundant indexes

-- Use it to see redundant indexes list

-- This query doesn't need any additional extensions to be installed
-- (except plpgsql), and doesn't create anything (like views or smth)
-- -- so feel free to use it in your clouds (Heroku, AWS RDS, etc)

-- (Keep in mind, that on replicas, the whole picture of index usage
-- is usually very different from master).
